# Summary: Prevent macOS from restarting apps after a crash.

# The following was originally based on code posted by user "patrick fogarty"
# on 2021-01-17 at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/411447

# Figure out the appropriate plist file.
uuid=$(ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk -F'"' '/IOPlatformUUID/{print $4}')
home=$(dscacheutil -q user -a name mhucka | grep 'dir:' | awk '{print $2}')
file=${home}/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.${uuid}.plist

# Delete the plist array.
if grep -q TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin $file; then
    /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Delete :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin' $file
fi

# Make the file read-only.
chflags uimmutable $file

# Save a note to the system log to confirm this was done.
# To read the log using the following command:
#
#   log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains "disable-restart-apps"'
#
# (Note: the log printing command above will be faster if you give it an
# argument to limit the time, such as --last 30m, but that only works if you
# run it shortly after logging in.)
logger "disable-restart-apps completed successfully"
